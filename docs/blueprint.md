## Style Guidelines:

- Use a color derived from the splash screen image, such as a muted teal or a warm terracotta, to reflect the natural tones and artisanal feel.
- A light beige or off-white, inspired by the splash screen's background, to create a clean and calming backdrop.
- Choose a deep brown or charcoal gray, reminiscent of the darker elements in the splash screen, to provide contrast and highlight key UI elements.
- Headline font: 'Lora' or 'Merriweather', serif fonts that evoke a sense of tradition and craftsmanship, complementing the artisanal theme.
- Body font: 'Open Sans' or 'Roboto', sans-serif fonts that ensure readability and a modern touch, balancing the traditional headline font.
- Use handcrafted, illustrative icons that reflect the artistry and cultural heritage of the crafts featured. Colors should align with the primary and accent colors.
- Employ a mobile-first design approach with a focus on clear information hierarchy and touch-friendly interactions to provide an engaging user experience. Ensure all elements fit within the mobile screen size without overlapping or requiring horizontal scrolling.
- Subtle animations, such as gentle fades or smooth transitions, to enhance the user experience without being distracting. Use natural, organic movements inspired by the crafts themselves.
